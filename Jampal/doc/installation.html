      commands in a command window.
    </p>
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pgbennett/ppa
sudo apt-get update

    <p>
      <b>Installation</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      To Install Jampal on your system proceed as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Microsoft Windows</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Download jampal-windows setup. Run the setup program and
      follow the instructions. If you do not have a suitable
      version of java installed the setup will prompt you do to
      download it from the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to use the command line utilities, such as
      creating playlists, printing envelopes, you must use the
      cygwin install instead. You will have to install Cygwin and
      the prerequisites mentioned below, then use the "Other
      Linux/Unix Environments including Cygwin" instructions
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Debian or Ubuntu Linux</b>
    </p>
    Run the package maneger to see if jampal is available as a
    download. If so, install from there. If you are installing on
    Ubuntu version 11.04 (Natty), see instructions at the top of
    this page for setting up the private package archive
    Otherwise download the correct jampal_*.deb and tagbkup_*.deb
    files. There are one of each for 32 bit systems and one for
    64 bit systems. First install the tagbkup file and then the
    jampal file. Double click on the file, and then select
    Install Package. Alternatively, you can also install a .deb
    file by opening a terminal and typing: 
<pre>
      sudo dpkg -i package_file.deb
   
</pre>
    <p>
      Required elements, including java, will automatically be
      installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Other Linux/Unix Environments including Cygwin</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Download the apppropriate jampal-build file for your setup.
      Untar it into a suitable location, then as root run "make
      install". You can uninstall it by running "make uninstall".
      You will need to make sure that you have a suitable version
      of java installed, also other prerequisites listed below.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is no package built for your version, you can
      download the source package and run "make install". You
      will need a java development kit and gcc compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Prerequisites</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Debian / Ubuntu install package automatically takes
      care of prerequisites. Other environments will need you to
      ensure that they are installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Jampal you need java version 1.6 or higher. To
      determine if you have this on your machine open a command
      prompt and type "java -version". If this fails you probably
      do not have java. If it displays a lower version than 1.6
      you will need to get a new version of java. To get the
      latest version go to <a href=
      "http://www.java.com">www.java.com</a> and follow the
      instructions. This is a free download and is available for
      Windows, Linux, Macintosh and Solaris. There are other
      vendors that supply java for other systems. If you would
      like to do java development get a free development kit from
      <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run the utilities in the jampal command, such as
      generating playlists, printing envelopes, and cleaning up
      your library, you need other components. You must have
      either a unix environment or cygwin under windows. You need
      sox, gawk and lame. gawk will be available with your unix
      or cygwin system, but sox and lame may need to be
      separately downloaded, compiled and installed. You also
      need openoffice.org writer and calc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Other environments</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have java installed, download the latest version
      of the generic setup zip file from <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=107584">
      the download site</a>. Unzip the file into a suitable
      directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>SUN Java MP3 plugin</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jampal has the "Tritonus" mp3 plugin included, and will
      play any mp3 file. If you prefer you can download the free
      <a href=
      "http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/mp3/download.html">
      SUN Java MP3 plugin</a>. If you have the SUN Java MP3
      plugin installed, jampal will play using that plugin
      instead of the "tritonus" mp3 decoder included in jampal.
      Jampal writes a trace message in the .jampal/jampal_err.txt
      file in your home directory to indicate which plugin is
      being used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Follow the install instructions on the web page. You do not
      have to install jmf or run the command which registers the
      plugin for jmf. Jampal is not a jmf application.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Running the Jampal GUI</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      With Windows, Debian or Ubuntu click the Icon in the Start
      menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      On linux or solaris you can run the jampal open command.
    </p>
    <p>
      On other environments run the command
      <br>
       java -Xincgc -Xmx256M -jar jampal.jar
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time you run Jampal it will create a default
      library. You can create new libraries by using the "Open
      Library" menu item. By default it creates the library in
      subdirectory ".jampal" of your home directory but you can
      select another directory in the open dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find out where your home directory is, select the "Help,
      About Jampal" menu item and scroll down to the last line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it has created the first library you can use "File,
      Open" to create additional libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Library Files</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jampal will create the following files on your hard drive:
    </p>
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td>
          xxxxxxx.jampal
        </td>
        <td>
          Properties file that contains a description of the
          library columns
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          xxxxxxxx.jmp
        </td>
        <td>
          Text file with tab delimited fields, contains one line
          for each track in the library
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          playlist.jampal
        </td>
        <td>
          Properties file that contains a description of the
          playlist columns
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          playlist.jmp
        </td>
        <td>
          Text file with tab delimited fields, contains one line
          for each track in the playlist
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          jampal_initial.properties
        </td>
        <td>
          Startup values for jampal such as which library to
          load. This file must always be in subdirectory
          ".jampal" of your home directory
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      You can move these to any directory of your choice, except
      jampal_initial.properties, which must remain in your
      ".jampal" directory. If you move them, the next time you
      run Jampal it will prompt you with an open dialog to locate
      the library and open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Please let me know if you find Jampal useful or if you
      find any bugs or shortcomings in it. Also I would like to
      hear from anybody who runs it on linux, macintosh or
      Solaris. The best way to do this is by <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=370097">posting
      a message</a> at the product information page or else send
      me email at pgbennett at users.sourceforge.net.</i>
